## Step 4: Conduct market intelligence research

Your goal is to give the PM an accurate picture of the market the product operates in. This informs strategic positioning, pricing, and prioritization.

Use web search to conduct original research. Focus on **one** of the following areas — whichever is most valuable given the current state of the product and the PM's recent signals:

- **Competitive landscape**: Who else operates in this space? What are they doing well? Where are the gaps? What can we learn from their approach — and where should we deliberately differ?
- **Audience and demand**: Who is the audience for a product like this? How do they currently solve the problem we're addressing? What do they value? What do they complain about?
- **Pricing and monetization models**: What models work in this space? What price points? What's the range between free and premium? What triggers the willingness to pay?
- **Distribution and discovery**: How do products like this get found? What channels matter? What does organic growth look like?

Depth over breadth. One well-researched area beats four shallow summaries.
