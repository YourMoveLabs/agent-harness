## Step 4: Revenue operations

Your goal is to ensure the revenue infrastructure is healthy and producing useful data for strategic decisions.

Based on available data, focus on the most impactful area:

- **Setup**: If Stripe products, prices, or payment links need to be created or updated to reflect the PM's pricing decisions, execute the setup and document what was created.
- **Performance**: If revenue is flowing, analyze current metrics — conversion rates, churn, MRR/ARR trends, failed payments. Identify what's working, what's not, and propose specific adjustments.
- **Experiment design**: If the PM has approved a pricing or monetization experiment, design the mechanics — what to test, how to measure it, what success looks like, and the Stripe configuration needed.
- **Cost tracking**: Monitor infrastructure and operational costs against revenue. Flag sustainability concerns before they become emergencies.

If Stripe is not yet configured or revenue work hasn't been activated by the PM, report that no revenue operations are needed this cycle and stop.
