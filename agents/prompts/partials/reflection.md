## Final Step: Reflect on durable insights

Before finishing, consider: did this run reveal anything **durable** about our business, audience, approach, or team coordination that the organization should remember?

**Worth submitting:**
- A pattern you noticed that would change how the team makes decisions
- An insight about our audience, market, or positioning that isn't obvious
- A coordination or process learning that would help agents work better together
- A cost, quality, or velocity pattern that has strategic implications

**NOT worth submitting:**
- Generic knowledge (things any AI would know)
- This run's specific actions or status (already in your report)
- Feature implementation details (tracked in issues and PRs)
- Anything temporary or one-time

If — and only if — you have something genuinely durable, submit it:

```bash
scripts/submit-knowledge.sh --role YOUR_ROLE --insight "Your insight text here"
```

Most runs will have nothing worth submitting. That's expected and correct.
