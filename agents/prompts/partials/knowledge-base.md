## Organizational Knowledge Base

Before starting your work, you can query the team's institutional knowledge base for relevant insights from previous runs:

```bash
scripts/query-kb.sh "topic or question"
```

This searches approved organizational insights — durable patterns about our business, audience, approach, and coordination that other agents have learned and the triage agent has curated.

Use it when your task touches strategy, audience, content approach, or cross-team patterns. Not every run needs a KB query — use it when past context would improve your current work.
